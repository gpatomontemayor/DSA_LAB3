# DSA_LAB3
Every day, the Health Department of the Community of Madrid receives a Map with the different health centers where vaccines must be delivered. The objective of this phase is to develop a data structure that allows to represent the distribution map. Such a map will be made up of the health centers. To simplify the practical case, in this phase, we are only going to store the name of each health center. The map, in addition to the health centers, also represents the possible connections or paths between the health centers. Thus, if two health centers are directly connected, the map will contain the distance in km between both health centers. On the map, there are health centers which are not directly connected, so it will be necessary to go through one or moreintermediate health centers. 

In this phase, we already provide you with the implementation of the Map data structure, with the following functionality:
- Function ```addHealthCenter()```, that allows adding a new health center to the map. 
- Function ```addConection()```, that receives two health centers and their distance in km. The function creates a connection between both centers.
- Function ```removeConnection()```, that receives two health centers, and removes their connection.
- Function ```__str__ ()```, that shows all health centers and their direct connections to other centers and their distances.
- Function ```areConnected()```, that checks if two health centers are directly connected. If they are connected, it returns the distance, otherwise it returns 0. 
- Function ```createPath()```, that allows visiting all health centers. The function returns a Python list containing the health centers in the order of visit applying the depth first search algorithm. As the starting center, we consider the first health center that was added to the map in its initialization.
- Function ```minimumPath()```, that receives two health centers, start and end, and that obtains the minimum path from start to end (applying Dijkstra's algorithm). The function returns a Python list with the delivery points that make up such minimum path (including start and end), and it also returns the distance between start and end.

The objective of this phase is to implement other versions of the minimumPath method but, instead of applying Dijkstra's path, applying other algorithms to obtain the minimum path (shortest distance in km) between two health centres. The algorithms to be applied are:
- The Bellman-Ford algorithm
- The Floyd-Warshall algorithm

The __Bellman-Ford__ algorithm calculates and returns the minimum path with its associated cost. If it finds a negative connection, it returns false. As in Dijkstra's algorithm, an array, d, is used to store the distances from a source vertex, s, to each of the vertices of the graph. Thus, for each vertex v in the graph, d[v] stores the cost of the minimum path from the source vertex s to v. An array, p, is also used to store the vertices previous to each vertex on the path from the source. The pseudocode for this algorithm is shown below:
```
Bellman-Ford (G,start)

Initialize:

  For each vertex v
    set d[v] = infinite
    p[v] = null
  p[start] = 0
For each vertex v
  For each connection (u,v)
    If d[v] > d[u] + w(u,v) then
    d[v] = d[u] + w(u,v)
    p(v) = u
For each connection (u,v) check
  If d[v] > d[u] + w(u,v) then
    return FALSE â€˜the algorithm does not converge
return True
```
The Floyd-Warshall algorithm allows finding the minimum path between all possible pairs of vertices of a graph. It uses the adjacency matrix (with the weights of each connection) and a matrix P to store the minimum paths. The pseudocode of this algorithm is shown below:
```
Floyd-Warshall (G)
Initialize
  Let D be the adjacency matrix (distances between vertices)
  Let P be a matrix to store the minimum paths
If i=j or Dij= infinite then Pi,j = null
otherwise Pi,j=i 
For k = 0 To len(V)-1
  For i = 0 To len(V)-1
    For j = 0 To len(V)-1
      Di,j = min(Di,j , Di,k + Dk,j ) 
      If min = Di,k + Dk,j then
        Pi,j = Pk,j 
```
Together with the statement of this phase, the following files are given to the student:
1. The file phase3.py which already contains the implementation of the Map class and which you have to complete by adding the methods minimumPathBF (based on the implementation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm) and minimumPathsFM (based on the Floyd-Warshall algorithm) to obtain the minimum path between the health centres. The file already contains part of the code, to help you get started.
2. The file unittest-phase3.py which already contains the tests needed to evaluate the methods that are already implemented in the file phase3.py. You must create the tests needed to validate the new minimumPathBF and minimumPathsFM methods. You should include as many tests as necessary to cover all possible cases to make your solution as robust as possible.
Note: In this phase, a health center does not include information about its patients.

Algorithm Analysis:

What is the temporal complexity of each of the functions requested in the statement? 
Justify the best and worst case, indicating its complexity. You must add your answer 
in a comment of the function.

Rules:
1. At this stage, the following Python structures are allowed: lists and dictionaries. 
2. Please upload only the file phase3.py to the task "Delivery Phase 3", 
created in the global classroom of your small group. Please do not rename 
the file or upload a zip. In the phase3.py file, include a comment with the 
name, NIA and small group of each team member. Only one member of the 
team should upload the solution proposed by the team. Deadline for delivery is 
May 12, 11:55 p.m.
3. Defence: During the face-to-face class on Thursday, May 13. The defence
of the Lab case is an oral exam. Attendance is mandatory. If a student does not 
attend, his/her grade in the Lab case will be NP. During this defence, the 
teacher will ask each member of the team a series of questions that must be 
answered individually. Each team member shall be able to discuss any of the 
decisions made during the design or implementation of any of the 
functionalities described in the case study. The final grade of the Lab case 
will be conditioned by the grade obtained in the defence. If a student is not 
able to discuss and defend certain decisions, he/she will not be qualified with 
respect to them, even if they are correctly implemented.
4. It is recommended to follow the recommendations described in Zen of Python 
(https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) and the style guide 
(https://www.python.org/dev/ peps / pep-0008 /) published on the official 
Python website
